## Project Requirements and Specifications

### 1. Introduction

- The project aims to develop a comprehensive platform for issue tracking, service rating, authentication, voting, and political engagement.

### 2. Functional Requirements

#### 2.1 Issue Tracking Module

- Users can submit issues categorized by department/authority, address, type (complaint, suggestion, problem), and intended audience (personal, public).
- Issues are assigned a status (e.g., pending, resolved) and can be tracked publicly.
- Users can vote on issues to prioritize them.
- Public commenting system for users to provide additional insights or support.
- Social media sharing integration for sharing issues.

#### 2.2 Service Rating Module

- Users can rate the services provided by departments/authorities.
- Service ratings are publicly visible.

#### 2.3 Authentication and Authorization

- Secure authentication mechanism with multi-factor authentication options.
- User registration and login functionality.
- Different user roles with varying levels of access (e.g., admin, regular user).

#### 2.4 Voting Module

- Users can cast primary and secondary votes in political elections.
- Primary vote represents the user's initial choice for a political party or candidate.

- Encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest.
- Role-based access control to protect user data and system functionality.

#### 3.2 Scalability and Performance

- Design for scalability to accommodate a large user base and increasing data volumes.
- Optimization of code, database queries, and network requests for performance.
- Utilization of cloud services for scalability and reliability.

#### 3.3 Usability and Accessibility
